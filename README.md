# Person Re-Identification using Siamese Network with Triplet Loss

## Overview

This repository contains a Python implementation of a person re-identification system using a Siamese Network architecture with triplet loss. The Siamese Network, combined with triplet loss, is a powerful technique for learning a robust feature representation for person re-identification tasks. This README provides an overview of the project and explains how to use the codebase.

## Features

- **Siamese Network Architecture:** The core of the system is a Siamese Network, a neural network architecture designed for learning similarity metrics between pairs of inputs.

- **Triplet Loss:** The network is trained using the triplet loss function, which optimizes the embedding space so that the distance between anchor-positive pairs is minimized, and the distance between anchor-negative pairs is maximized.

- **Dataset:** The code is compatible with various image datasets suitable for person re-identification tasks.

- **Pre-trained VGG16 Model:** The VGG16 convolutional neural network, pre-trained on ImageNet, is used as the base architecture for feature extraction.

- **Training and Evaluation:** The repository provides scripts for both model training and evaluation. Training involves generating triplet samples and optimizing the network using gradient descent. Evaluation measures the performance of the model on re-identification tasks.

- **Customizable:** The code includes customizable hyperparameters for model architecture, training, and evaluation, allowing easy experimentation.

## Usage

1. Prepare your dataset in a suitable directory structure.
2. Adjust hyperparameters in the configuration file, if needed.
3. Run the training script to train the Siamese Network using triplet loss.
4. Run the evaluation script to assess the performance of the trained model on re-identification tasks.
